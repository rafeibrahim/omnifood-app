# Planning for web application

## Sections

Sections based on content provided by the client

- Logo + Navigation
  (even though we are planning for only landing page of this web app but it can be helpful to have links in the navigation component which will lead users to different sections on the page)
- Hero
- Featured in
  (small sectio with logos of companies using this application)
- How it works
  (important section about how omnifood app work)
- Meals (and list of diets)
  (section for possible meals generated by app in case users sign up.)
- Testimonials + Gallery
  (testimonial section is all about social proof that other users have already bought the subscription and that's worth it and gallery of images will be displayed side by side in order to lure the customers to sign up)
- Pricing + Features
  (priciing section is normally last section before CTA in modern web designs. A small features section highlighting core features of the app and what the customers are actually signing for.)
- CTA (Call to Action)
  (CTA section for signing users up.)
- Footer
